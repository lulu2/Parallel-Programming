1. Run following commands first to set environment:
setenv CULA_ROOT [PATH OF YOUR CULA LOCATION]
setenv CULA_INC_PATH $CULA_ROOT/include
setenv CULA_LIB_PATH_32 $CULA_ROOT/lib
setenv CULA_LIB_PATH_64 $CULA_ROOT/lib64
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $CULA_LIB_PATH_32

2. Run 
make build32

3. Run
./kernel #threshold #image_set 
to show the result, for instance for image set of 4096 iamges:
./kernel 10 batchData_4096_10label.txt 



read_batch.py: convert data_batch_1 file to a text file for following C/C++ implementation.
ReadImageData.cpp, ReadImageData.h: Functions that read in image batch data from a text file
PCA.c, PCA.h: functions that read in image batch data and perform PCA algorithm
